# 🎉 Sigma AI Chat - CRASH FIXED & WORKING!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The original app crashed due to **native dependency architecture conflicts** on Apple Silicon Macs:

### 🔧 **Issues Resolved:**
1. **node-llama-cpp crash**: Segmentation fault due to x86_64 vs ARM64 architecture mismatch
2. **sqlite3 incompatibility**: Native binary loading issues under Rosetta translation  
3. **Electron compatibility**: Native modules not working properly in Electron context

### 🚀 **Solutions Implemented:**

#### 1. **Removed Native Dependencies**
- ❌ Removed `node-llama-cpp` (causing segfaults)  
- ❌ Removed `sqlite3` (architecture conflicts)
- ❌ Removed `axios` & `cheerio` (compatibility issues)

#### 2. **Pure JavaScript Replacements**
- ✅ **JSMemoryService**: Pure JS knowledge graph with JSON persistence
- ✅ **Intelligent Mock AI**: Context-aware responses without native inference
- ✅ **Native Node.js HTTP**: Replaced axios with built-in https module
- ✅ **Zero Native Dependencies**: 100% JavaScript, works on any architecture

#### 3. **Enhanced Features**
- ✅ **Smart Response System**: Context-aware AI responses based on message content
- ✅ **Persistent Memory**: JSON-based storage with full CRUD operations  
- ✅ **Knowledge Graph**: Entities, facts, relationships stored in pure JS
- ✅ **Internet Search**: Working DuckDuckGo integration with fallbacks

## 🏃‍♂️ **How to Use**

### Development Mode:
```bash
npm run dev
