# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is a new, empty Git repository. The codebase structure and development commands will need to be established as the project develops.

## Development Setup

Once the project is initialized, common commands to look for include:
- Package manager setup (npm install, yarn install, pip install -r requirements.txt, etc.)
- Build commands 
- Test commands
- Linting and formatting commands

## Architecture Notes

The codebase architecture will be documented here as the project structure is established.

## Important Notes

- This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the project structure and development workflow are established
- Add specific build, test, and development commands once they are defined
- Document the overall architecture and key design patterns as they emerge
